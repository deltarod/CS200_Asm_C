NAU - CS 396 Scheme and UML Projects. 

This repository contains my solutions for Project 2 and Project 3 for the
Principles of Languages course at the Northern Arizona University. 

The prompt for Project 2 is added in the "Project 2 Scheme.pdf" file. 

The prompt for Project 3 was open ended and required an airport to be modeled using UMPLE.
